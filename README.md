# AtlantaConnections
I searched on the Delta website on a particular day in January 2022 and found all Delta flights departing out of Atlanta or arriving to Atlanta that I could which were operated by an Airbus A321. This gave me a big set of data where for each flight I could find, I had the gate it arrived to or departed from in Atlanta, as well as the time at which it arrived or departed. My program went through this data and matched arrivals to departures, so that in the end one could see, for example, that an A321 flight from Boston that arrived in Atlanta at gate B13 then proceeded to depart to Los Angeles afterward. I applied many tools from my Advanced Programming in Java class to write the program.
