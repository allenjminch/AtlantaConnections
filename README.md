# AtlantaConnections
I have a long-standing interest in commercial aviation, and specifically in airport operations. After taking my first Java class, I applied my new programming tools to a personal coding project to match arriving and departing flights by time and gate number at an airport to identify pairs of arriving and departing flights which used the same exact plane. For what is shown in this repository, I worked with Delta Airbus A321 aircraft at the Atlanta airport on a single day in January 2022. In the txt file of output, as an example, the line "San Antonio --> A11 --> Ontario" means that one of the Airbus A321 aircraft I found arrived at Atlanta from San Antonio at Gate A11 and then proceeded to depart to Ontario, CA immediately afterwards. At the end of the output file are some arrivals and departures I did not manage to match.
